**Example 3.4: Using comparison operators**
```
x = 5
y = 2
print(x > y)  # output: True
print(x == y)  # output: False
```
**Logical Operators**

* `and` (logical and)
* `or` (logical or)
* `not` (logical not)

**Example 3.5: Using logical operators**
```
x = 5
y = 2
print(x > y and x < 10)  # output: True
print(x > y or x < 0)  # output: True
print(not x > y)  # output: False
```
**Assignment Operators**

* `=` (assignment)
* `+=` (addition assignment)
* `-=` (subtraction assignment)
* `*=` (multiplication assignment)

```
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
# output: x is less than or equal to 10
```
**3.3.2 For Loops**

For loops are used to iterate over sequences, such as lists, tuples, or strings.

**Example 3.8: Using for loops**
```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```
**3.3.3 While Loops**

While loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

**Example 3.9: Using while loops**
```
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
# output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```
**3.4 Functions**

Functions are reusable blocks of code that take arguments and return values. In Streamlit, functions are used to encapsulate logic and make code more modular and reusable.

Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. They are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and even other lists. In Streamlit, lists can be used to store and manipulate data in a variety of ways.

**Creating Lists in Streamlit**

To create a list in Streamlit, you can use the `[]` syntax, just like in regular Python. For example:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
st.write(my_list)
```
This will create a list `my_list` with the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and display it in the Streamlit app.

**Indexing and Slicing Lists in Streamlit**

Just like in regular Python, you can access and manipulate individual elements of a list in Streamlit using indexing and slicing. For example:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing an individual element
st.write(my_list[0])  # Output: 1

# Slicing a list
st.write(my_list[1:3])  # Output: [2, 3]
```
**Using Lists with Streamlit Widgets**

Streamlit provides a range of widgets that can be used to interact with lists. For example, you can use the `st.selectbox` widget to allow users to select an element from a list:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

selected_fruit = st.selectbox('Select a fruit', my_list)
st.write(f'You selected: {selected_fruit}')
```
This will create a dropdown menu with the elements of `my_list`, and display the selected element in the app.

**Dictionaries in Streamlit**

Dictionaries are another fundamental data structure in Python. They are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. In Streamlit, dictionaries can be used to store and manipulate data in a variety of ways.

**Creating Dictionaries in Streamlit**

To create a dictionary in Streamlit, you can use the `{}` syntax, just like in regular Python. For example:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
st.write(my_dict)
```
This will create a dictionary `my_dict` with the key-value pairs `name: John`, `age: 30`, and `city: New York`, and display it in the Streamlit app.

**Accessing and Manipulating Dictionary Elements in Streamlit**

Just like in regular Python, you can access and manipulate individual elements of a dictionary in Streamlit using the key. For example:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Accessing an individual element
st.write(my_dict['name'])  # Output: John

# Updating a dictionary element
my_dict['age'] = 31
st.write(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}
```
**Using Dictionaries with Streamlit Widgets**

Streamlit provides a range of widgets that can be used to interact with dictionaries. For example, you can use the `st.selectbox` widget to allow users to select a key from a dictionary:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

selected_key = st.selectbox('Select a key', list(my_dict.keys()))
st.write(f'You selected: {selected_key}')
```
This will create a dropdown menu with the keys of `my_dict`, and display the selected key in the app.

**Sets and Tuples in Streamlit**

Sets and tuples are two other important data structures in Python. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, while tuples are ordered collections of elements that cannot be modified once created. In Streamlit, sets and tuples can be used to store and manipulate data in a variety of ways.

**Creating Sets and Tuples in Streamlit**

To create a set or tuple in Streamlit, you can use the `set()` or `()` syntax, respectively. For example:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
st.write(my_set)

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
st.write(my_tuple)
```
This will create a set `my_set` with the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and a tuple `my_tuple` with the same elements.

**Using Sets and Tuples with Streamlit Widgets**

Streamlit provides a range of widgets that can be used to interact with sets and tuples. For example, you can use the `st.multiselect` widget to allow users to select multiple elements from a set:
```python
import streamlit as st

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

selected_elements = st.multiselect('Select elements', list(my_set))
st.write(f'You selected: {selected_elements}')
```
This will create a checkbox menu with the elements of `my_set`, and display the selected elements in the app.

**Conclusion**

In this chapter, we explored how to work with Python data structures in Streamlit. We covered lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, and demonstrated how to create, access, and manipulate these data structures in Streamlit. We also showed how to use Streamlit widgets to interact with these data structures in a variety of ways.
